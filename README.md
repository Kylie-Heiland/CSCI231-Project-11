# CSCI231-Project-11
This program is used to determine an account balance for a bank. Four elements in an Account array are created; two accounts are Checking, and the remaining are savings. 

## Checking Accounts ##
- Has no interest rate, so this program sets the balance and ID for the account, withdraws an amount, and then deposits an amount back in.

## Savings Accounts ##
- Has an interest rate. The interest rate is first applied to the original balance of an account; then as the account withdraws an amount, the interest rate will apply to the new balance. When an amount is deposited, the interest rate will apply to the new balance yet again.
